# fitnessTracker

An app intended to track gym workout sessions in a very detailed and easy to understand manner. This project is my first ever coding project which I tried to tackle, then I realized I need to learn a lot more before committing to create an android app. So, it is in an abandoned, and pretty bad/basic state right now. 

I will come back to this project again because this app is a need for me, and programmers are meant to satisfy their needs :)
